# ── Deliberate divergences from gold ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Cells where the graders applied their OWN written rule inconsistently and both
# implementations apply it uniformly. These are decisions, not defects, and they
# were documented in README prose only — so every harness counted them as errors.
# That cost real conclusions: Q4a reads as one of handout 1's least accurate
# items at 80% exact / 92.8% per check, and is 94% / 98.0 once its three declared
# cells come out. And the DAY2 work was justified partly by "7 of 10 large errors
# are over-credit" when three of those were p8's declared avoidance-framing cells
# — the README says in terms, "anyone measuring the OC items should subtract them
# before concluding the criteria are too permissive."
#
# Distinct from three neighbouring ideas, all of which already exist:
#   olx_prompts.SCORING_DIVERGENCES  — where the WEB and CLI differ from each
#                                      other, not where either differs from gold
#   agreement.UNSCORED_GOLD_CRITERIA — criteria no slot scores at all
#   PER_ITEM_EXCLUDE                 — cells DROPPED, because nothing correct can
#                                      score them. A divergence is still scored;
#                                      we just knowingly disagree.
#
# Q6/9 and Q1/20 appear here for the record and are also in PER_ITEM_EXCLUDE, so
# they never reach a comparison. The other seven do.
