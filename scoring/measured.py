"""The measurement ledger: which items were measured, at which prompt, on which cells.

    python3 measured.py --status                 what is stale, what is pending
    python3 measured.py --record Q1 OUT/Q1.runs.json    after a sweep of Q1

An item's published number is only meaningful against two things: the prompt the
grader was sent, and the set of cells the rate was computed over. Change either
and the number is stale — but nothing in the tree LOOKED different, because both
changes are invisible after the fact. A rewritten rule is a diff that landed
weeks ago; a removed exclusion deletes the only record that the cell was ever in
question. An item whose denominator moved and whose prompt was rewritten is
byte-identical, in git, to an item nobody has touched.

That is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-24 an audit found Q1 had five exclusions
removed and its six citations rewritten into rules in the same commit, with no
sweep afterwards — its last item-level measurement predated both changes, and
its reported number rested on re-derivation. Two other guards had gone in that
same day (`olx_prompts --write` naming UNMEASURED sections, `compare_runs.py`
refusing unprobed verdicts) and neither could have caught it: one fires at write
time and prints to stderr, the other only if someone runs it. Guard prose in
QUALITY_CONTROL.md could not catch it either, because the guide had said to
measure and had been read.

So the ledger records, per item, the SHA of the prompt text that was measured
and the exact exclusion set it was measured over. `check_items_are_measured_as_configured`
in enforcement.py recomputes both from the working tree and fails when they
disagree — which turns "someone must remember to re-measure" into a check that
names the item and what changed under it.

Recording is deliberate and mechanical: `--record` reads the run artifact and
writes the entry, so an entry cannot claim a measurement that was not run, and
nobody hand-types a SHA.

A gap may be DECLARED rather than closed, in this project's usual idiom: an
entry may say `pending` with a reason, which the check lists instead of failing
on. What it may not do is be absent. An item that is neither recorded nor
declared is a hard failure, because silence is what let Q1 through.
